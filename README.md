A Java core task for an internship at the Open Cascade IT company:
---

  The program asks the size of the array at the start (checks that the size is not less than 10, and that a digit was entered and not a text, and that the digit is an integer)
After that, it creates an array of the desired size and fills it with numbers in order (1,2,3...n)
, Then takes a random number from the array and deletes it. I.e., the array should decrease by one element and become size n-1.
The next step is shuffling the array. It is necessary for the n-1 array to be thoroughly mixed (to do this with your own code, without resorting to ready-made mixing libraries)
Your task, in the minimum number of actions, is to find the lost element from the shuffled array (the one that we accidentally deleted).
